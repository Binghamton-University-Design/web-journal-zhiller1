	            <h3><a href="">About Me</a></h3>
	            <p>I would best describe myself as a Product Designer who creates work spanning multiple mediums, with a passion for intrinsically creating solutions for others through my own vision. I would divide the work that I create, as it relates to my career aspirations, into the following two categories: User Experience Design work, and Graphic Design work. I have an extensive background in drawing, painting, mixed media, printmaking and photography. With careful study and practice I have learned how to enhance the quality of my work by applying learned principles of art to my more end-to-end design centered projects.

<p>My interest in end-to-end design began when I was a child. I found myself obsessed with the exponentially growing digital world - I was enthralled by the function of smartphones and laptops, as products, and the vast possibilities they brought to users. I remember being extremely anticipatory about every software update, no matter the size or import.  I clearly recall three questions in my mind repeating themselves. They can be paraphrased as: “how can tech companies just keep improving upon things that exist”, “how can they create all of these new ideas”, and “I wish I could contribute my ideas so that I could create things to help people”. 

<p>User Experience Design can be defined as ‘the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users’, I feel as though this small obsession later grew into a revelation that helped me discover my passion. 

<p>As a child, I was prolific in creating artwork for my pure enjoyment, but I found that the majority of my early-on projects geared me towards wanting to make a change or an impact to a design. The easiest example for me to remember would be that I was in love with drawing and designing houses and architecture - with key functions specific to all of my family and friends - simply due to having a desire to improve their lives. I would draw a clock in each room of a house so the occupants would always know the time, for example.

<p>I have carried these passions for reimagining and re-engineering over into my adult life, and my developing career. I have created prototypes in my UX Design work (staying true to the principles of creating visual appeal) that span from improving existing interfaces, to introducing apps that invent solutions for problems that I have identified through research and my own life experiences. 

<p>In my Graphic Design work, I have learned to create projects that are aesthetically appealing but efficiently meet the needs of my professors, bosses, or coworkers. 

<p>Knowing how to merge my own inspirations and ideals with the requirements of my clientele has allowed me to work towards being a Product Designer who aspires to perfecting his craft. It excites me to be mindful of every possible detail within the realm of visual experience - color, texture, movement, and text - while striving towards the goal of solving societal, technological, and artistic obstacles.

<p>My work, which is represented in a variety of mediums and projects, is apparent through the effort and heart that goes into it, and what it stands for: positive impact.</p>
