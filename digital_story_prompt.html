	            <h3><a href="">My Digital Story Prompt</a></h3>

<p>For my Digital Story, I would like to create a game-like experience where one is presented with a series of correct and incorrect choices, almost like a quiz, after reading an informational paragraph.
In specifics - I want to create a Russian cooking game!
I had the idea of someone beginning some sort of story/game simulation, where a user is presented with a picture of my own grandmother’s kitchen… an image of her would pop up from the bottom, and a little text bubble would appear, saying “Would you like to learn how to make cheese pancakes?” (this is a classic Russian recipe, “Syrniki” are slightly sweet, cheesy Russian pancakes made from Farmer's cheese. They are super soft and just slightly sweet on the inside)...

<p>The user could then click yes, or no. If no, the image of my grandmother would smack you with a spoon, if yes, you would be able to proceed to the game starting. There would be a little loading screen, with some sound effects and light transitions, before beginning.
	First, I imagine the game would start with a little glyph talking about the history of Russian cooking and cheese pancakes, with some images that I’d like to pop up and some russian music playing.
	Once the user would finish reading the prompt, they would begin playing the game. I’d like the game to be a series of questions, as the recipe progressed, imitating the “yes” and “no” system of the intro… For example, one question would be, “What is the first ingredient we add to the bowl?”, and the choices would be, “Cheese” (CORRECT) “Eggs” (INCORRECT), keep in mind the correct and incorrect would not be indicated, but depending on what the user chose, the animation would be displayed with a “DING” or “EHHH” sound. 

<p>I’m still debating the amount of questions, but I think a range of 10-15 would suffice for the recipe. I will add the ingredients followed by the recipe into this prompt below:


<p>- 2 cups farmer’s cheese about 16 oz (crumbled into measuring cup)
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour I use Bob’s Red Mill
- 2 oz cream cheese
- 1 large egg
- 4 tablespoons cool whip
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon table salt
- grapeseed oil to fry vegetable ok too

<p>1. Measure 2 cups of farmer’s cheese by crumbling the cheese by hands and lightly placing it into a measuring cup (don’t try to pack it). Transfer cheese into a medium bowl and break any bigger pieces with a fork. Add cream cheese, cool whip, vanilla extract and large egg; mix it/break it with fork and then finish with spatula until well combined.
<p>2. In a separate small bowl, combine and whisk together: all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder and fine salt. Add dry ingredients to cheese and with the help of spatula, stir together until everything is fully combined. Batter will be sticky, but not runny (if too runny, add 1-2 tbsps flour).

<p>3. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-low heat and drizzle about 2-3 tbsps oil. While the pan is heating, use a small ice cream scoop to make small cheese balls and place onto a cutting board covered with a plastic food wrap. Once the pan is heated, flatten each cheese ball on your palm to about 1/2″ thickness and place onto the pan (if batter starts sticking to hands, dip hands into flour or wipe with oil). Saute in hot oil over medium-low heat about 2-3 mins per side. Flip over when starting to golden on bottom-side edges. Transfer to a platter and serve warm with your favorite topping such as sour cream, jam and fresh fruits, with a glass of an orange juice or milk. Enjoy!


<p>I also would like to display images of the ingredients as each question is selected, with little sound effects, such as sizzles, pops, or pan flips! I would like to have the same Russian song from the beginning continually playing as well. 
When the game ends, I would like to tally up the correct and incorrect answers, and provide a “You Win” or “You Lose” message. If the user loses the game, they should be allowed the opportunity to restart the game. There will be a button that says “Start Over”, and once the game is replayed, users will have the option to skip the informational section of it, and go right into the questions again. If the user wins the game, it will say “Congratulations, you won!” and a cheering sound will go off, with a picture of my grandma clapping her hands.


<p>I’m really excited to develop this digital story/game, I think it will tie in some humor with some cultural history really well.
